My first and only job was at the old ford factory in victoria. i worked there during the 1970s and 1980s. management installed me to keep track of peoples hours. the guys on the shop floor hated me for it. it took me a while to realise they blamed me any time they were late and got fined two dollars by management. the guys thought i was keeping tabs on them. i suppose they were right. when i figured this out, i started to do things differently. if someone arrived a few minutes late, i set my clock back so it looked like they bundied on right on time. and if someone was close to qualifying for overtime, i rounded the time up when they bundied off. the blokes loved me after that. i enjoyed working with them.
